#   This will use a stable tag that is known to work with the specified
#   level of hypervisor. An AP creation fix added after this tag exposed
#   a hypervisor bug and breaks AP booting with the specified level of the
#   hypervisor. Please report any failures with this level of UEFI/OVMF,
#   so they can be addressed.
